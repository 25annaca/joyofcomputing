    <p class="writing" font-size: 40px;>Hi, I'm Anna Caputo. I was born in September of 2007, and I am a virgo. I am from Piedmont California and have lived here since I was 5 years old. Previously I lived in Oakland. I go to school at Piedmont High School. At school I am on varsity swim team, and I have been swimming since 4th grade, when my good friends Kalindi and Julia convinced me to join the team, since then they have both quit. But thats ok! I also do debate, but I only started doing that this year. I enjoy to read and to bake cookies in my free time. My favorite book is Little Women. One of my favorite subjects is English which expands the amount of books, and different kind of genres that I read. My favorite color is yellow, and I also have a dog named Roxy. She is a psycho, but I still love her. She is the dog in the picture to the left.</p>
