    <p class="writing" lign = "left"> This is the first thing of Art that I made in high school, I really like it. The project was to create a ribbon drawing, but I chose to expand on that and create a jellyfish to make the drawing more interesting.</p>

    <p class="writing" align="left"> This is my bread from the bread project, we had to make sour dough bread using a starter and perform experiments on it. My experiment was that one bread would use all purpose flour, and the other would use rye bread. I made two loaves of rye bread and sourdough bread. I won the most sour bread.

    <p class="writing" lign = "left"> Another project I've been working on is an html website in Joy of Computing, it has been really interesting, and I have learned a lot because I have coded it all myself. This project is actually the website that you are looking at right now. I hope that you like it!</p>

    <p class="writing" lign = "left"> The fields that I chose to show in my collage are, web design, data analysis, video game design, and computer science in the real world. Computer science is used in web design by having that be what codes it. Data analysis uses computer science by having the cs make the analysis easier. Video game design is also like web design, computer science is what codes it. Lastly, robots in the real world use coding so they can interpret real life situations. I would like to learn more about video game design, I find it really interesting, and cool how people can make video games out of coding.
